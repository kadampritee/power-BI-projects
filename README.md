## Sales & Profit Data Analysis by using Power BI Visualization tool.
This is my Power BI project which I have done by myself. Here I have created a Power BI Dashboard which shows the sales done and profit created by different products, by different cities by countries by different regions.
In this dashboard, I have found different patterns from the given data and I have extracted different insights from the given data.
First of all, I cleaned the data.
Then I checked the data types of the attributes of the data whether it is correct or not if they were not then I corrected them.
I found out for any duplicate data present or not.
If necessary then I created calculated fields also.
I also append the tables to make it easy to visualize the data in a proper manner.
